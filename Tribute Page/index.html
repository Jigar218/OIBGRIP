        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose and Janakinath Bose on
          23 January 1897 in Cuttack—in what is today the state of Odisha in
          India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal Province in British
          India. Prabhavati, or familiarly Mā jananī , the anchor of family
          life, had her first child at age 14 and 13 children thereafter. Subhas
          was the ninth child and the sixth son. Jankinath, a successful lawyer
          and government pleader, was loyal to the government of British India
          and scrupulous about matters of language and the law. A self-made man
          from the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he had remained in touch with
          his roots, returning annually to his village during the pooja
          holidays.

          Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of
          British authority in India made him a hero among Indians, but his
          wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy
          vexed by authoritarianism,anti-Semitism, and military failure. The
          honorific Netaji (Hindi: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose
          in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion
          and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India
          in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.
